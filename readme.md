# React appointment planner #

A Codecademy practice project

## What it does ##

This project, written with React (and a little React Router), simulates an appointment planner. It's not hooked up to anything on the backend, so don't use it as a real appointment planner!

The requirements were to make two pages that accept either contacts or appointments. Contacts have names (required) and contact info (optional). Appointments have titles (required), dates and times (optional), and can be with a contact or with nobody.

In addition to what the requirements specified, I added a way to delete contacts and/or appointments. I also allow users to select multiple contacts to meet with.

Icons are from fontawesome!
